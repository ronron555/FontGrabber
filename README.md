# Font Grabber

A browser Extension that scraps the CSS stylesheets, finds, and organize the font links for you to download. Also, it can convert the fonts (Powered by Transfonter) to TTF using the same interface.

## TODO

- [ ] Check if there is an easy option to install
- [ ] Build a landing page to download the extension
- [ ] Firefox implementation
